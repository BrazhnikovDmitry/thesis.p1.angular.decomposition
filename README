This is going to be the first chapter of my thesis where it is presented:
1) a method based on gravity wave directional decomposition for application in numerical models
2) its application to shallow gravity wave diffraction by submarine mountain
3) its application to reflection/scattering of mode-1 internal tide by step discontinuity
