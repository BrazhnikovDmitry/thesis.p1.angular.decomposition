\title{Diagnosing angular (directional) spectra by Tikhonov regularization (ridge regression, tapered least squares) in numerical studies of wave scattering (wave-topography interaction)}
\maketitle

\section*{Abstract}
Realistic numerical simulations of wave propagation (both surface and internal) involve complex patterns of interference that conceals energy transfers. The elementary wave components can be deduced from angular spectrum. Here, the energy distribution is found by solving an inverse model based on plane wave dynamics. The solution method is a least square minimization augmented with penalizing term (Tikhonov regularization). This aids stability in presence of noise and provides better spectral resolution for under-sampled signal. Further, applicability of the method for energy estimates is tested against analytical solution of wave scattering by bottom topography. In the first problem a periodic shallow gravity wave attacks a circular island. The inverse model correctly identifies energy lobes and their amplitude, hence, allowing to examine scattering amplitude in more complex environments. In the second test, a low mode internal wave reflects from a continental slope represented as step topography. Estimated bulk reflection coefficient compares excellent with the analytical solution. But in case of three dimensional topography the method as well provides information on spatial variation of point-wise coefficient due to inhomogeneity of the prescribed incident field. The results lend confidence in robustness of the inverse technique, hence, suggesting its applicability to field observations of the real ocean.

\section{Introduction}
The oceanic waves interfere and create obscure character \footnote{(change?)} in currents and pressure. The staggered pattern makes difficult to answer the simplest questions about waves: from where are they coming and how strong they are. Hence, there will always be an uncertainty in estimate of energy transfers and budgets. In an example of a standing wave, no energy transfer is taken place, yet two waves are present but oppositely traveling. The problem of diagnosing elementary components inevitably emerges in studies of wave-topography interaction. Energy is transfered into scattered wave field that undoubtedly has large number of components. This might produce spatially (horizontally) tight beams of energy transport. Such phenomena was observed in numerical simulations of tsunami waves (\cite{tang2012direct}) and internal waves of tidal frequency (internal tides) (\cite{simmons2004internal}, \cite{arbic2010concurrent}(?)) (and in observations (\cite{zhao2016global})). To present a method to deduce dynamics of a complex wave field such as aforementioned ones is a chief reason for this note (chapter, paper).\\% And it is application to problems of tsunami wave scattering by submarine island and reflection of low-mode internal tide.\\

A straightforward method is to obtain spatial frequencies of elementary waves (\cite{barber1963directional}) by means of two dimensional Fourier transform. It further can be mapped onto a circle leading to angular spectra. In the field studies this approach was extensively used in relation to surface wave phenomena, e.g. propagation (\cite{munk1963directional}, reflection (\cite{dickson1995wave}, \cite{thomson2005reflection}, island diffraction (\cite{pawka1983island}). The spectral description was also applied to tsunami trapping (\cite{romano2013wavenumber}) and internal tide propagation (\cite{hendry1977observations}, \cite{lozovatsky2003spatial}). Estimation of spectra is a problem that one encounters and here is dealt by inverse modeling (\cite{long1986inverse}). As discrete Fourier transform leads to ambiguity in elementary wave direction, additional inferences are necessary. Even though application of the Hilbert transform can resolve the issue (\cite{mercier2008reflection}) \footnote{(Will it work with many components? In presence of corrugated surfaces?)}, it does not utilize all wave field characteristics available. Logically, constrains of wave dynamics are expected to lessen Gibbs phenomena, increase directional resolution and provide a way to super-resolution (\cite{kay1981spectrum}, \cite{sacchi1998interpolation}) so essential (viable, relevant, crucial) for resolving short-crested waves.\\
%the constrains of wave dynamics are expected to lessen

The inverse approach has to comprise dynamical statements of the wave field. So that angular spectrum will be related to (translated into) observed pressure and currents simultaneously. But such postulated problem leads to overdetermined and ill-posed system of equations, naive least square solution is unstable in relation to small changes or errors in data. For example, errors in numerical simulations might arise due to numerical and physical friction (reference?) leading to nonuniform wave amplitudes over sampling window of the numerical ocean. Hence, regularization is generally necessary to stabilize and improve inverse estimate (\cite{munk2009ocean}, \cite{snieder1999inverse}). In studies of wind wave spectra this is a well known approach when penalizing terms are added to cost functions. These terms can comprise constrains on spectrum shape and smoothness (\cite{long1979variational}, \cite{herbers1990estimation}), spectrum sparseness (\cite{hashimoto1989directional}, \cite{sacchi1996estimation}\footnote{this is geophysics reference}, or statistical properties (\cite{benoit1997analysing}). Unfortunately, the mentioned methods cannot be utilized in studies of wave-topography interaction. The scattered field is ``phase-locked" with incident one and thence, phase must be retained in the model equations (e.g. \cite{thomson2005reflection}) leading to deterministic wave decomposition. This is in contrary to wind waves of open sea that are mainly stochastic.\\

The simplest regularization technique, nevertheless powerful one seeks an inverse estimate of minimum variance. Initially developed by \cite{tikhonov2013numerical} for solution of Fredholm integral equations, Tikhonov regularization has a wide application starting from theoretical work in acoustics (\cite{colton1996simple}) and holography (\cite{williams2001regularization}) to observational oceanography (\cite{munk2009ocean}) and geophysics (\cite{snieder1999inverse}) where it is named ''tapered" or ``damped" least squares. But it has never been used \footnote{Dushaw used similar inverse} to oceanic wave problems. In the first section the inverse model will be formulated in order to find angular spectrum of waves. The developed approach than (Section 3) is illustrated on simple synthetic experiments to show its performance characteristics. And in later sections (4 and 5) is applied to numerical experiments of wave scattering where comparison with the well-known analytical solution is taken place. In section 6 concluding remarks are made and drawbacks are outlined.\\
\footnote{Should I add plane-wave fit? ``subtraction" method of Jody (and Zygmunt)?}
~\\

%The simplest way to identify the scattered components is to numerically remove bottom disturbance (\cite{kowalik2008kuril}, \cite{klymak2016reflection}). Than set new experiment to obtain differences which will provide insights into distribution of energy. This method can provide satisfactory results only if ``subtraction" of bathymetry is possible, that is there is no surrounding complexity. And if one is not interested in the energy transfers occurring over the topography which can be a case for a study on trapped wave motions. As well in complex numerical simulations when mesoscale conditions is simulated in the same time as wave phenomena, clearly removement of bathymetry will lead to different background physical conditions such that interaction between waves and background conditions will be erroneous.\\
%In classical observational wave () literature premises of linear wave field are used to obtain directional spectra, $|A(\sigma, \vec{k})|$. Fourier transform can be carried out in order to obtain frequency-wavenumber spectra. This defines distribution of wave energy in frequency-wavenumber space differential intervals. To obtain this different methods might be employed (). Here the trivial approach is considered based on plane-wave fit methods (). The basic approach to find spectral representation is to use underlying wave dynamics and use plane wave fit. This is a traditional approach in analysis of satellite altimetry observations (\cite{ray2001estimates}, \cite{zhao2016global}). In application of regular plane wave fit though there is a drawback that only finite number of components can be resolved. This problem arises as least squares method can infinitely increase amplitude in order to decrease misfit. This will lead to unphysical results. One of the ideas to solve this problem is setting additional restriction on amplitude. So this is why obtaining non-negative wavenumber spectra will bring better performance.\\
%In order to show feasibility of directional wave spectra in numerical experiments we proceed as follows. In section it is given the basic definition and description of numerical procedure. As well it is studied its characteristics on a synthetic data. With outlined procedure comparison of wavenumber spectra to an analytical solution of SGW diffraction by seamount is carried out (Section 3a) and comparison with reflection of internal tide from step-like continental slope is done with comparison with an appropriate analytical solutions (Section 3b). In section 4 concluding remarks are made.\\

\section{Regularization technique of obtaining angular spectrum}
\subsection{Mathematical preliminary}
Let pressure or sea level in complicated seas to be described by angular spectrum\footnote{This is not spectrum per se, is term usage still possible?},
\begin{equation}
\label{C1:eq.spectrum}
p(\vec{r}, t) = \int_0^{2\pi}  d\theta_k S(\theta_k) e^{i \vec{k}(\theta_k) \cdot \vec{r} + \phi(\theta_k) - i \omega t}
\end{equation}
Here each elementary (monochromatic) sine wave of wavenumber $k$ travels in direction $\theta$ with energy $S(\theta)^2 d\theta$ and temporal (spatial) lag of $\phi(\theta)$. Through out the note temporal dependence is omitted and complex notation is inferred. It is sought to estimate the angular spectrum $S(\theta)$ and phase distribution $\phi(\theta)$ from a finite set of observations. At first, this problem is reformulated in terms of Fourier coefficients (\cite{benoit1997analysing}, \cite{rafaely2004plane}) by application of Jacobi-Anger expansion \footnote{(should I cite anything?)},
\begin{equation}
p(r, \theta) = e^{i \vec{k}(\theta) \cdot \vec{r}} = \sum_{m = -\infty}^{m = \infty} i^{m} J_{m}(k r) e^{im(\theta - \theta_k)}
\end{equation}
shows that a field at point $(r, \theta)$ produced by plane wave can be expanded in series of Bessel functions and circular functions. Than its substitution into \eqref{C1:eq.spectrum} and reorganization lead to
\begin{equation}
\label{C1:eq.series}
p(r, \theta) = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{m=\infty} \big[ \int_0^{2\pi}  d\theta_k S(\theta_k) e^{i\phi(\theta_k)} e^{-im\theta_k} \big] i^m J_m(kr) e^{im\theta}
\end{equation}
Term in brackets (square brackets) represent convolution integrals defining Fourier coefficients of order $m,~A_m - i B_m$. Thence, series \eqref{C1:eq.series} state a model equation to find the unknown coefficients from the known, measured pressure field. Its spatial distribution can be sampled at a set of points $(r_i, \theta_i)$ and infinite series are truncated at order $N$ both leading to matrix formulation\footnote{should i drop infinite series here?},
\begin{equation}
\label{C1:p.eq}
p_i = \sum_{m = -N}^{m = N} J_m(k r_i) e^{im(\theta + \pi/2)} (A_m  - i B_m)
\end{equation}
Real and imaginary parts constitute two separate problems allowing deterministic definition of the spectrum. Angular spectrum and phase distribution will be recomposed as usual by
\begin{align*}
S(\theta_k) e^{i \phi(\theta_k)} = \frac{1}{\pi} A_0 + \frac{2}{\pi} \big[ \sum_{m = 1}^{m = N} A_m \cos m\theta_k + i B_m \sin m\theta_k \big]
\end{align*}
The same steps are repeated but with current velocities instead, starting from \eqref{C1:eq.spectrum} transfer functions are inserted invoking plane wave dynamics,
\begin{align}
\begin{Bmatrix}
u(\vec{r}, t) \\ v(\vec{r}, t)
\end{Bmatrix}
=\int_0^{2\pi} d \theta_k \frac{k}{\rho_0 (\omega^2 - f^2)} 
\begin{Bmatrix}
\omega k \cos \theta_k + i f \sin \theta_k \\ \omega k \sin \theta_k - i f \cos \theta_k
\end{Bmatrix}
S(\theta_k) e^{i \vec{k}(\theta_k) \cdot \vec{r} + \phi(\theta_k)}
\end{align}
Than dependence of currents on wave bearing causes splitting of Fourier coefficients and asymmetry via Coriolis effect,
\begin{align}
\label{C1:uv.eq}
\begin{Bmatrix}
u_i \\ v_i
\end{Bmatrix}
= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{m = -N}^{m = N} J_{m} (kr_i) e^{im(\theta + \pi/2)}
\begin{Bmatrix}
(\omega - f) A_{m + 1} + (\omega + f) A_{m - 1} - i [(\omega - f) B_{m + 1} + (\omega + f) B_{m - 1}] \\ 
(\omega - f) B_{m + 1} - (\omega + f) B_{m - 1} + i [ (\omega - f) A_{m + 1} - (\omega + f) A_{m - 1}]
\end{Bmatrix}
\end{align}
This results points out that to describe velocity field higher circular harmonics have to be employed. Physically, velocity field has higher spatial variability. This is well known idea since spatial differentiation acts as a high-wavenumber filter (e.g. \cite{rhines1977dynamics}). But in \eqref{C1:uv.eq} additionally, the asymmetry is observed for clockwise and counterclockwise components.\footnote{This is bad, but discussion is necessary}

\subsection{Inverse technique formulation}
Inverse model sets its goal an estimation of angular spectrum from observed field characteristics. This relation is posed by \eqref{C1:p.eq} and \eqref{C1:uv.eq} and formally expressed as,
\begin{equation}
y = K x
\end{equation}
where $y$ measured pressure and currents, $x$ - Fourier coefficients and $K$ - model coefficients. The statement does not need to be strictly satisfied as the model might not be fully correct such as in case of non-planar waves or presence of errors. Additionally, $K$ does not have to be a square matrix, e.g. it is possible to have less measurements than unknowns. Hence, there will be a residue and measure of solution's success should be imposed, such as in least-square minimization, $\min \{ ||K x - y||^2_2 \}$ -  to find a solution with minimum residue in $L_2$-norm sense. And the least-squares solution  will be found as Moore-Penrose inverse (\cite{bennett1992inverse}). Generally, it will be unstable to small errors in data and produce physically inconsistent results (ill-posedness). Addition of regularization parameter is to solve the issue. As in Tikhonov regularization, an inverse solution should minimize the following cost function,
\begin{equation}
\label{C1:Tikh_prob}
x_\alpha = \text{arg}\min\{||K x - y||^2_2 + \alpha ||x||^2_2\}
\end{equation}
The second term controls amount of solution's variance with a weight $\alpha$ called a regularization parameter. It can be shown that this parameter represents a low-pass filter over orthonormal vectors of $K^TK$ (\cite{williams2001regularization}). This becomes clear as solution is explicitly expressed,
\begin{equation}
x_{\alpha} = (K^T K + \alpha I)^{-1} K^T y
\end{equation}
So that factor $\frac{\lambda_k^2}{\lambda_k^2 + \alpha}$ ($\lambda_k$ - singular value) is introduced to damp small singular values. Unfortunately, this decreases solution and exerts dependence of $x_{\alpha}$ on the regularization parameter: for $\alpha = 0$ regular least-square estimate is obtained, while for large $\alpha$ minimizer is close to zero. Its choice cannot be made a priori and has to be data-driven. In field studies this is usually set by a signal-to-noise ratio (\cite{munk2009ocean}), since it has to scale noise variance to actual signal's strength. Many techniques exist (\cite{williams2001regularization}), but there is no silver bullet approach and everything depends on problem of interest. Here straightforward method will be used that is called L-curve (\cite{hansen1993use}).\\
As mentioned, in Tikhonov regularization amount of allowed error is competing with solution's norm. The simplest idea is to find an optimal parameter balancing both factors. This is seen as rapid change in behavior of curve associating residue with solution's norm as regularization varies (Figure 1). The two extremes for $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ and $\alpha \rightarrow \infty$ are observed as straight vertical lines. A sharp corner connects two regions and a point with maximum curvature is proposed to be used as a regularization parameter.

\caption{L-curve example}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Synthetic example to illustrate method}
The so-described method is not different as a regular Discrete Fourier transform of finite time 
series. Here, the spectrum is found over data-points organized in circular antenna, only spatially 
finite region is known (Figure 2a). The solution will have a finite number of orders and this will 
result in Gibbs ringing (Figure 2c). The role of regularization is seen in oversmooothing of the 
spectra and decrease of spectral resolution. In case of perfect model penalized least squares will 
always worse than direct fit. But as some inconsistency appear in the data (modeled here as white 
noise with 1\% variance of main signal) the least squares result in unphysical spectrum. On the 
other hand, white noise improves the penalized least squares solution.\\
It is apparent that maximum order is a crucial characteristic for resolution. From the expression 
(ref-to-spectrum reconstruction) it is seen that two wave will be separated in principle if $ 
\delta \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{N_{max}} $ (\cite{rafaely2004plane}). In the inverse model 
formulation this directly depends to Bessel function. And since these coefficients depend order and 
$ k d_{antenna} $ only later can increase resolving power of the method. But if velocities are used 
in conjunction with pressure observations the order can be increased at least by one as follows 
from the inverse model formulation (\ref{C1:uv.eq}) where there is a shift between Bessel function 
and coefficients. In the following example two waves cannot be discerned since antenna size is two 
small to satisfy Rayleigh criteria, $ sin \delta theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{d_{antenna}} $, so the 
reconstructed spectrum shows one smeared wave. But if velocities are augmented to the data, there 
is an increase in resolving power and waves are actually resolved.\\
Note in the numerical application observed velocities are scaled so that variance of 
residue will have similar magnitude with pressure. \\

\section{Test problems of wave scattering}
The aim of this paper is to obtain spectrum which later is used to infer physical properties of 
wave-topography interaction. In the case of wave interaction there is an energy transfer from 
incident wave into scattered. And spectrum can be used to delineate this energy process. Usually, a 
researcher is interested in spatial characteristics of scattered wave field (cite Sato?) or in some 
bulk quantity such as reflection coefficient (\cite{klymak2016reflection}). These two problems will 
be studied by application of the proposed method. The simplest problem are taken for which 
analytical solution is well known, so that comparison between the method result and exact solution 
could be made. Additionally, auxiliary experiment is carried out with no topography which result is 
subtracted from the total field so that exact scattered wave in terms of numerical experiments can 
be studied.

\subsection{Example diffraction of shallow-gravity wave}
The infitinite periodic wave train is sent impinging on a seamount represented by a cylinder of 
radius 40 km rising from plane bottom ocean of depth 5km to the depth of 250 m. The 3 experiments 
of different period are performed. In the numerical experiment it is used the simplified numerical 
code developed by (\cite{kowalik2005numerical}). All nonlinear terms were neglected, while bottom 
friction is controlled by constant coefficient of $3.3 \cdot 10^{-3}$. The integration is carried 
out over grid with resolution of $2~km$ by $2~km$. The boundaries are open, so all scattered waves 
are traveled away without reflection. The periods are taken to be 10, 15 and 20 min so 
that different regimes in response can be caught such as Diffraction and No-interaction.\\
After quasi-equilibrium is reached temporal Fast Fourier transform is employed to find amplitude 
and phase of the strongest wave at each grid point (Figure 4a). Than Fourier coefficients are fed 
into inverse model so that directional spectrum is estimated. The antenna is organized by 
concentric circles of radius $ \lambda/2,~\lambda/4,~\lambda/8 $ where $ \lambda $ is a wavelength 
found from dispersion law of shallow-gravity waves. Each circle is discretized in 100 points that 
are projected to the nearest grid point, so actual number of points per circle might be smaller.\\
The total field is a clear pattern of interference fringes following circularly spreading scattered 
from the seamount waves. At the same time due to large wavefront compare to wavelength there are 
diffractive maxima in the incident wavefield. It is clear that the wavefield is complex. It is 
unclear how much energy was transmitted into the scattered components and what its spatial 
structure. Here the scattered wavefield is reconstructed from spectrum as averaged sealevel emitted 
from the seamount in direction where spctrum is found (Figure 4a).\\

each grid point is shown as well. Period of the forced wave is 10 min.\\

\subsection{Results and discussion}

\subsection{Example: reflection of internal tide from step discontinuity}
In the next problem an internal tide reflection from simplified topography is studied. The internal 
tide is given by the first baroclinic mode prescribed on the right side of channel with.\\
The MITgcm is employed where a nonrotating channel ends with discontinuity whose depth is changed. 
The channel 
depth is constant of 2000 m and ocean is uniformly stratified with Brunt-Vaisala frequency $ N^2 = 
1.5 \cdot 10^{-5} $. The horizontal resolution is 8 km. In vertical there are 25 equally 
discretized levels. Around the box sponges of 6 grid cells are set to absorb reflected waves.\\
On the right side a low-mode internal tide is prescribed with frequency of $ M_2 $ harmonic as 
perturbation in temperature profile and velocity field following respective mode-1 eigenfunction 
structure. Horizontally the basic field is perturbed over 450 km section to decrease diffractive 
effects. Additionally, the so-generated beam is let to freely propagate to get rid of edge effects 
and obtain spatially uniform field. The beam than impinges on a step topography where reflection  
and scattering into higher modes take place (Figure 6).\\
The model calculated fields are saved over two periods, harmonically analyzed. From temperature 
field one can obtain baroclinic pressure anomaly (\cite{Kelly2010}). This then are fit to eigenmode 
structure functions. So per each dynamical field quantity a complex amplitude is found. These are 
further used in spectrum estimate. The antenna for analysis is built in the same way as in previous 
example.\\
In such problems one is usually interested in estimate of energy being reflected. The reflected 
wave is defined here as all easterly propagating waves, i.e. compass directions located in the 
first and fourth quadrant. The energy flux is than can be reconstructed for these directions and 
compared with subtraction method (Figure 6b).\\
Energy conservation\\
The bulk reflection coefficient on the other hand can be obtained as a ratio of total incident 
energy going through a cross section and total reflected energy traveling away. As additional check 
this can be compared with results of analytical solution (\cite{chapman1981scattering}) (Figure 
7).\\

and reflected waves creating a standing wave pattern.

\subsubsection{Test description}
\subsubsection{Results and discussion}

%Bessel functions decay... super fast\\
%The so-chosen basis functions are not orthogonal, this leads to ill-conditioned matrix K, the solution is unstable for small changes in the data. Some sort of regularization is necessary. Here we choose the simplest of most is Tikhonov regularization. The minimization problem to solve is (or to use cost function)
%
%Here the first term is part of regular least-squares solution and represents minimization of residual. The second term minimizes variance. One tries to find a balanced solution that has minimum residual and smallest norm trade-off parameter.
%But success and resultant fit depends on a regularization parameter. The parameter acts as a high pass filter over eigenvectors of $K$ (\cite{williams2001regularization})\\
%In case of rapidly varying bathymetry a local cutoff to drop stations is based on WKB-alike condition, i.e. variations in wavenumber are much smaller compare to its value.\\
%The formed matrix equations is solved by means of linear programming methods \cite{haskell1981algorithm}.\\
